            Your primary task is to evaluate a candidate's resume against the given job description, ensuring the best possible guidance for resume optimization. The job market is highly competitive, so you must provide precise, actionable feedback to enhance the resume's ATS compatibility.

            Analyze the following resume text carefully and provide detailed improvement suggestions based on industry best practices and ATS optimization techniques.

            Evaluation Criteria:
            1. ATS Match Score ‚Äì Assign a percentage score (%) indicating how well the resume aligns with the job description.  
            2. Missing Keywords ‚Äì List any essential keywords or technical skills from the job description that are missing in the resume.  
            3. Section Formatting Issues ‚Äì Identify any problems with headings, section names, and date formatting that may affect ATS parsing.  
            4. Job Title Match ‚Äì Check if the candidate's job titles align with the job description. If not, suggest ways to incorporate them naturally.  
            5. Contact Information ‚Äì Verify if the resume contains an address, email, and phone number, and highlight any missing details.  
            6. Education & Certifications ‚Äì Identify whether the education section is properly structured and meets job requirements.  
            7. Hard Skills Matching ‚Äì Compare listed skills in the resume with those in the job description and provide a skills alignment table.  
            8. Resume File Format ‚Äì Check if the resume is ATS-compatible (e.g., PDF) and suggest improvements if necessary.  
            9. Overall Summary & Improvements ‚Äì Provide a professional summary of the findings, along with personalized recommendations for enhancing ATS compliance.
